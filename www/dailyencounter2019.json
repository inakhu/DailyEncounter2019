Psalm 56:4, NIV <\/h3>\n\n<\/center>\n\n<p> \nElisabeth Elliot\\'s books tell of her life as a missionary and\nthe wonderful lessons God has taught her over the years. But her life had not always been \\'wonderful.\\' She\nhad lost two husbands: the first, missionary Jim Elliot was\nkilled by the Auca Indians in Ecuador while he was trying to reach them with the Gospel. The second, Addison Leitch, died\nof cancer. In telling these experiences, Elliot said, \u201cIn the first shock of death, everything that has seemed most dependable has given way. Mountains are falling, earth is reeling. In such a\ntime, it is a profound comfort to know that although all things\nseem to be shaken, one thing is not: God is not shaken.\u201d\nElliot\\'s confidence in God in the midst of her troubles is similar to the psalmist\u2019s trust in God.\nWhen King David wrote Psalm 56, he was in the midst of crisis (cf.1 Samuel 21:10-15). Many\ntake this psalm as an individual lament, but it could also be a psalm of anticipated thanksgiving.\nThe description of troubles and prayers changed into gratitude that God has heard and will act.\nWhen it looked like he would be swallowed up, the psalmist trusted God.<i> \u201cWhen I am afraid, I\nwill trust in you. ... I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?\u201d<\/i>(vv. 3-4)\n<\/p>\n        \n<p> Regardless of your previous experiences, this year, God wants you to trust Him\nabsolutely. You may not know what the year holds, but with your trust in the God who\nknows the end from the beginning, you will have a fruitful\nyear. God is forever trustworthy because He is faithful. Let go of all your fears, and trust Him every step of the way. And\nHe will surely act on your behalf. Have a trust-filled year!\n<\/p>\n\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>  Trusting God brings stability in the midst of troubles.<\/p>\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Are you willing to put your absolute trust in God this year? <\/p>\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Make a list of those situations that bring fear, and trust them to God to handle. <\/p>\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b> Heavenly Father, I trust my life and family to you this year.

Cyrus would fulfil the prophecy when he allowed God\\'s people to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple (Ezra 1:2-4). Gabriel gave insight into Daniel\\'s vision and helped him to\nunderstand the prophecy and fulfilment of it.

One Sunday morning he decided to go to a church.\nAs he made to enter the church, he was stopped by some ushers who told him that the church was for high- caste Indians and whites only. They told Gandhi to seek a church where his own people worshipped. He left and never went back. He said, \u201cIf Christians have caste differences also, I might as well remain a Hindu.\u201d Brother James emphasised that keeping the royal law of love requires that we treat people equally and fairly. James\nwas speaking against the error of treating people who are rich better than those who are poor in the church of God. He stated that the act of dishonouring the poor in the church to honour the wealthy, who came from outside, is a sin. When the royal law of love is violated, it is a violation of all other laws.\n<\/p>\n\n        \n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p> \nNot many people like to associate with poor people. Everyone likes to associate with the rich and the high of the society. Every human being is susceptible to the temptation of considering those who appear well above those who are less\nprivileged. The admonition of James is that if that is what obtains in the world, the Church should set the right example by treating everyone equally, regardless of their economic status or any other basis by which we discriminate against people. Partiality or favouritism violates the Royal Law. Treating the rich better than the poor goes against loving your neighbour as yourself.

Instead of being anxious about\nlife\\'s turns and twists, he enjoins us to take everything to God in prayer and\npetition, with thanksgiving.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTo keep this peace of God, we must watch what goes on in our thought realm\nbecause whatever we think about has very great impact over our lives. This is\nwhy we must consciously think about things that are true, noble, right, pure,\nlovely, admirable, excellent and praiseworthy. When we give way for the peace\nof God to keep watch over our hearts, strife will not be able to set in; hatred,\ngrudges and unforgiveness will have no room and anything that contradicts\nGod\\'s peace will not be associated with us.\n<\/p>\n\n<p><b> Wisdom : We must deliberately guard our heart. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Who do I need to forgive now? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Forgive every offence, no matter the gravity <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>       Lord, help me to rejoice always in You.     <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<HR\/> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\n Ottuh John, Delta; O.

Unknown\nto Caiaphas and the others, it was God that inspired him\nto speak, as the high priest that year, to endorse Jesus as\nthe Passover sacrifice (v. 51). This shows that God can\nuse anyone to advance His plans. We see different views about the death of\nChrist. While the Jews thought He was just a criminal they handed over to the\nRoman authorities for punishment, God knew the reason He let Him die.\n<\/p>\n\n        \n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p> \nHis death is still the only way for humans to be saved (John 3:16).

Because Christ died,\nwe are saved from eternal death which awaits those who reject His death and\nresurrection. Because He took our place, we are freed\nfrom the punishment for sin, which is death.

As the Chief\nShepherd laid down His life for humankind, we are\nrequired to do the same by demonstrating empathy and\nsympathy to the people, caring for them at different\nlevels, knowing their challenges and sharing in their\nfeelings. Jesus demonstrated agape love for His sheep;\nas leaders at different levels, we are required to do the\nsame.\n<\/p>\n                        \n\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>We are to\nemulate Jesus Christ,\nthe Chief Shepherd.<\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Can God depend on\nyou to be a good\nshepherd? <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Go and tend the\npeople God has placed\naround you as God\ndesires. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b> Lord, help\nme to emulate You as a\ngood shepherd.<\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\n I.

In a similar vein, Psalm 57\ncontains David\\'s experience at a period in his life when he\nhad to flee into a cave for safety, running away from Saul\nwho wanted to kill him. Though God had anointed him to\nbecome Israel\\'s king after Saul, his life was in great danger\nday-by-day, so much that it looked like he would never\nbecome king. David could have doubted God\\'s ability in\nthe wake of his afflictions, but he did not do that. The first\npart of the psalm describes David\\'s affliction, his cry for\nmercy unto God and an expression of assurance of God\\'s protection against the disaster to come. Though David is hiding in a cave, he does not\ntrust the cave for protection; rather, he places his trust in God. His enemy has set a net to\ncatch him (v. 6), yet he sets his heart to praise God (v. 7).

Combining the two can then\nderive \\'attitudes that bring blessing\\'. Jesus had to remove\nHimself from the crowd, to a mountainside where only His\ndisciples were with Him. There He taught them right\nattitudes for blessed living. To be poor in spirit means to be\ndependent on God totally in life, acknowledging one\\'s\nhelpless state. To mourn here refers to mourning over sin.\nSomeone said \u201crepentance means you\\'re sorry for something you did\u201d while another said more accurately, \u201cIt means you\\'re sorry enough to quit.\u201d To\nmourn over sin is to express the appropriate sorrow that leads one to stop sinning.\nMeekness is not weakness but strength submitted to God\\'s\ncontrol and will. To hunger for righteousness is to desire to\nbe Christlike in everything we do. Mercy is the willingness\nto withhold judgment even when the offender deserves it.\nTo be pure in heart is to have inner integrity which leads to\noutward integrity. Having had peace with God through\nChrist\\'s sacrifice, we seek to reconcile others to God. Being\nrejected is not a desirable experience, but Jesus says when\nwe are persecuted for His sake, we have heaven as a reward.\n<\/p>\n\n        \n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p> \nTo be blessed of God is to be approved of Him and it\nis amazing to see that what it means to be approved of in\nthe world contradicts what it means to be approved of in\nGod\\'s kingdom.\n<\/p>\n                        \n\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>Beatitudes are not multiple\nchoices where one is\npicked and others left.<\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Kingdom people have\nattitudes different from\nthe world\\'s because\nthey have a different\nhope.

But their mower made so much\nnoise that it disturbed the neighbours. When their\nneighbours complained to them, they apologised and\npromised to fix the problem. What might have\ndeveloped into a feud eventually became the evidence\nof their good will. This incident gives a clear picture of\nhow Christians should relate with other people in godly\nwisdom. Paul concluded his letter to the Colossians with a series of instructions on relationship with others.\nOne of the instructions is being wise in the way they act towards outsiders. One way to\nshow that wisdom is the way we speak. The first thing people assess when they meet a\nbeliever is perhaps the speech. We need God\\'s wisdom in\nrelating with people both in speech and in actions. The\nbook of James talks about godly wisdom which is pure,\npeace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy,\nimpartial, sincere and produces good fruit. Godly wisdom\nis the ability to understand and apply the word to every\naspect of life (Matthew 7:24-25). So, to grow in godly\nwisdom is to grow in the knowledge of God\\'s Word. The\nmore you are filled with the word of God, the more the\nwords of your mouth will be gracious (Colossians 3:16).\n<\/p>\n\n        \n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n \n\n\n                        \n\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>Out of the\nabundance of the\nheart, the mouth\nspeaks.<\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Am I a shining example of a\nkingdom citizen to the world? <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Watch out for\nsituations where you\nneed to act wisely\ntoday. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>Dear Lord,\nhelp me to do the\nright thing always.<\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\n J.

They were known for\ntheir adherence to the laws of Moses even though most\ntimes they missed out on the spirit of the law. They only\npaid attention to the letters of the law but neglected the\nessence of it. They never understood that Jesus is the\nfulfilment of the law; they rather saw Him and His\nteachings as a contradiction to the laws of Moses. This\nof course is a form of blindness on their part. With this wrong perspective, they\nalways questioned Jesus\\' actions and were curious to know His perspective on\nevery matter, with the intent to trap Him.\n<\/p>\n\n        \n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p> \nThis time around, they wanted to know the greatest commandment in the\nlaw. Jesus\\' response was very simple \u2013 Love. To Jesus, love is the fulfilment of the\nlaw and the end of all commandments. While they placed emphasis on pleasing\nGod through keeping to legalistic standards; Jesus placed emphasis on loving\nGod and others. They could draft a law for every aspect of human living; but\nJesus\\' desire is that they should develop a deeper love for the Lord, His word and\nHis will. The same message is applicable to us.\nWhatever religious activities we do without love does\nnot please God.

He also recommends that women should focus on cultivating\ninner beauty, which is more attractive than outward beauty. Is Peter against\nChristian women looking attractive? No. Rather, he is saying that without a gentle\nand loving spirit, good looks is not capable of fostering the kind of love that will\nkeep a man and woman together, or win an unbelieving spouse to Christ.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\nFurther, Peter admonishes husbands to be considerate with their wives, treating\nthem with respect as the weaker partner and as co-heirs with them of the gracious gift\nof life in Christ.

Paul Bwas raising money to help the believers in\nJerusalem, and he used Jesus\\' example of giving\nup what He has for the sake of humanity as an example of\nwhat it means to give. Christ left all His riches and glory\nabove and became a man in order to enrich our lives. Paul\nemphasised that grace giving must come from a willing\nheart, and must not be done as a response to coercion. To\nencourage the Corinthian believers, Paul had earlier used\nthe example of the Macedonian Christian, who were not\nrich, but willingly gave out of their extreme poverty. If the Macedonian church could\ndo that much, then the Corinthian church could do better. Paul argues for striking a\nbalance in Christian giving, such that there will be no one who does not have, and there\nwould be no one who is burdened with the need to give. Paul quoted from Exodus\n16:18 to illustrate the principle of fair balance in giving: everyone gathered what they\ncould, some more and some less; but they all shared what\nthey gathered. This is not to encourage those who come to\nchurch with the aim of exploiting others to enrich\nthemselves.

From\nPeter\\'s sermon we can deduce that the heart of the Gospel is Jesus Christ, who\ncame preaching peace to the sons of Israel.

But when we consider them in the\nlight of God\\'s Word, by the help of the Holy\nSpirit, we will act according to wisdom. Today\\'s text points\nus to some values we must develop. We must learn God\\'s\ntruth (vv. 1-4). The will of God is revealed in the Word of\nGod (Col. 1:9-10), and the only way to know His will is to\nstudy His Word and obey it. When we receive the Word of\nGod, we experience growth in godly character, and mercy\nand truth become beautiful ornaments in our lives (Prov.\n3:3; 1:9). It is not enough for us to carry the Bible in our\nhands; we must let the Holy Spirit write it on our hearts (v.\n3; 7:3; 2 Corinthians 3:1-3).\nWe must obey God\\'s will (vv. 5-8). The fulfillment of God\\'s promises is predicated\non our obedience to the Word. We must share with God first, our blessings (vv. 9-\n10) for He is the source of both our spiritual and material\nblessings. The Old Testament Jews brought to the Lord\nthe firstlings of their flocks (Exodus 13:1-2) and the first\nfruits of their fields (Leviticus 23:9-14) in\nacknowledgment of God\\'s goodness and sovereignty.\nThe New Testament parallel is seen in Matthew 6:33. We\nare to seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness\nand all other things shall be added unto us. We lean on our\nown understanding when we do not obey Him totally.\nWhen we trust in the Lord and acknowledge Him in all\nour ways, we will see Him making our paths straight. As\nyou go out today and every day of your life, keep God\\'s\ncommandments and He will remove the obstacles on\nyour way; make your path smooth and bring you to your\nappointed destination.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\n\n<\/p>\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :Obedience\nto the Word of God\ncan add years to your\nlife and life to your\nyears. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Those who follow\nwisdom have easier,\nless problematic life. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Determine today to\nbe a faithful and\ngenerous giver. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :Lord, I\nreceive the grace to\nbe godly, keeping\nY o u r\ncommandments in\nJesus\\' name. <\/b>            <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<HR\/> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:S.

No wonder, Apostle Peter\nsaid it was good and delightful to be there, suggesting\nto have three booths built there; one for Jesus, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\nThe story of transfiguration reveals certain aspects of the glory of Jesus Christ.\nThese are the glory of His person and the glory of His kingdom. The presence of\nMoses and Elijah was significant. Moses represented\nthe Law while Elijah the Prophets. This means that all\nof the Law and Prophets point to Christ and are fulfilled\nin Christ (Luke 24:27; Hebrews 1:1). We can share in\nthe glory of Christ\\'s transfiguration every day. When\nwe surrender ourselves to God, He will \u201ctransfigure\u201d\nour minds (Romans 12:1-2).

Jesus came to Nazareth, the city where he\nwas brought up; and the reception given Him made Him\nuse this proverb: \u201cNo prophet is accepted in his own\ncountry\u201d. Jesus used the Old Testament story of Elijah\nand the widow as well as Elisha and Naaman to draw\nhome the tragedy of familiarity. Why would God send\nElijah to the widow who is not an Israelite while there\nwere other widows in Israel at that time? Why would\nNaaman, a leper who travelled all the way from Syria\nreceive his healing while many Israelites who lived so close to Prophet Elisha\nremained in their sickness? The answer is familiarity.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\nThe response of the people in the synagogue confirms Jesus\\' saying. Instead\nof accepting Jesus\\' rebuke, they became furious and took Him to the top of a hill\nto throw Him down and have Him killed. But Jesus slipped away from their\nmidst because His time had not come. The people of Nazareth forfeited the\nblessings that could have been showered on them if they had not despised Jesus.\nFamiliarity robs us of great encounters with God that\nwould have brought about unprecedented\nbreakthroughs. When we get too familiar with spiritual\nthings, they lose meaning to us, and we only do them as\nsomeone going through the motions. Like Jesus, one\nwho is being despised should not fail to do whatever\nGod has placed in his or her hands. But we all should\nlearn to acknowledge others\\' strength and esteem their\nworth.

His letter gives us\nsignificant insight to prayer. His summary\nprinciple is: the fervent prayer of a righteous person\navails much. Prayer is one of the effective weapons\nGod has given us. It places us in contact with the\nAlmighty God, and it brings almighty results. But it is\nalso true that the amount of our faith determines\nwhether God will answer our prayers or not.\n\u201cThe prayer of faith\u201d as used in our text is the prayer\nthat is in agreement with God\\'s will, offered with confidence in the authority of\nJesus over sickness and other works of darkness. To be effective means to be\ndone through the effectual working of God\\'s power. To be fervent is to be\npersistent and insistent. Jesus told us to keep on asking,\nseeking, and knocking. The verbs are in the continuous\npresent tense, indicating something that we do without\nstopping. A righteous person is one who set his or her\nheart to obey God, living in agreement with His Word\nand character. The impact of prayer on our lives,\nchurch and nation is beyond measure. That is why we\nmust not give up praying, fervently, continually, and in\nfaith to activate the desired change that we seek.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :There are\nblessings that God\nhas chosen to give,\nonly as His people\nask Him in faith. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :How fervent are you\nin prayer? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Offer a prayer of\nfaith today over the\nsick in your family\nand church . <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :Father, help\nme to always pray in\nfaith , and in\nagreement with Your\nwill in Jesus\\' name. <\/b>            <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<HR\/> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:A.

Faith was counted to him as\nrighteousness.

We live in a\nhurting world, and there is a desperate need for a message\nof true hope to overcome despair and of real power to overcome our weakness.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\nThe account of Jesus raising a dead young man shows that the life-giving word\nof Christ is the message of hope and power in a world such as this. Jesus was\nmoved with compassion when He met the mourners at the city gate. The woman\nwho had initially lost her husband was in despair over the loss of her only son. She\nhad no power to combat death, which had taken away all\nthat she had. But Christ\\'s life-giving word brought hope\nand power into that sorrowful scene.\n<\/p>\n<p>The tragedy of death is a reality of life. It is a\ncompletely hopeless occurrence if we face it apart from\nthe One who has power over it. That Jesus raised the\nson of a widow from the dead is a sign that God is\n\u201camong His people\u201d in Jesus. If you are experiencing a\ngreat loss now, Jesus sees, even when everybody else\ndoes not. And He says to you today, \u201cDo not weep.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom : God\\'s\nreign turns weeping\nlaughing. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought : Can one be a true\ndisciple and be\ndispassionate toward\npeople in need? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : Rely on the promise\nof Jesus to comfort\nyou with the Holy\nSpirit in every trial\nthat comes your way. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer : O Lord,\nincrease my faith in\nYour love and\ncompassion and envelope me with Your comfort. <\/b>            <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<HR\/> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:Badaru, V.

Their needs are to be given utmost attention in order for them to focus on\nthe work of preaching and teaching. Furthermore, charges against elders must be\nsupported by more than one person to help guard against false accusations.\nElders and pastors are in human beings, who could sometimes make mistakes.\nTheir mistakes could be magnified by the fact that they are in the public view.\nNonetheless, elders who sin are to be rebuked in love to\nhelp others who are prone to such act.\nTwo of the most difficult issues in life are\naccountability and discipline; whether at home, work,\nor church.

She said it was her response to the call the pastor\nmade the previous day. The pastor would not take the\nmoney at first, but then, she burst into tears and pleaded\nwith him to let her partake of the blessing.\nJust like the pastor in the story above, Paul wrote to the church at Corinth to give\ngenerously to the church in Jerusalem which was going through severe hardship.\nPaul described God as the Supplier of all good things of life who gives believers,\nseed and bread. Bread is for our consumption but seeds are to be sown, to\npractice generosity. Paul explained that the purpose of God enriching us with His\nblessing is for us to be generous on every occasion. When we walk the path of\ngenerosity, God blesses us with a harvest of more seeds so that we can\ncontinually be a blessing to others while the glory goes to God.\nAll believers at all levels can be generous, because\ngenerosity is not limited to money. It includes sharing\nfood, material possessions, time, ideas, love, respect\nand other things with others.

However, Paul spoke of a debt\nwe must never finish paying, an obligation we must continue to fulfil: the\nobligation to love one another.\nLove is the basis of the Christian life. Loving our neighbours as we love\nourselves proves that we are true disciples of Christ. To love is to want, wish and\ngive what is best for others just as you want for yourself. When we love others,\nwe will not purposely harm or do evil to them. Rather, we seek to promote their\npeace and prosperity.

Romans chapter 8\nfollows a long passage which describes Paul\\'s agony\nand lamentation about his desire to do what was right\nand his inability to do so. In this chapter, Paul began\nwith a shout of victory and freedom. He declared that\neveryone who gives his life to Christ has gained\nfreedom from the law of sin; he is a new creature in Christ, buried with Him out\nof the reach of condemnation and raised with Him into a new life of\nrighteousness. Paul elaborates on the difference between a life controlled by the\nsinful nature and a life controlled by the Holy Spirit.\nThus, for every Christian, there are two possibilities:\nyielding ourselves to be controlled by self or yielding\nourselves to the control of the Holy Spirit.\nAs believers, we have been empowered to live a new life\nby the Holy Spirit. Thus, we should not follow our sinful\nnature. If we follow our sinful nature, we will be under its\ncontrol and will end up sinning. But if we follow the Holy\nSpirit, we will constantly think about things that please\nthe Spirit and thus live a victorious life.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :New life\nin Christ is only\npossible through the\nhelp of the Holy\nSpirit. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Is my life being\ncontrolled by sinful\nnature or by the Holy\nSpirit? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Decide to yield\nyourself totally to\nthe Holy Spirit. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :Spirit of the\nliving God, fill me\nafresh with grace to\nplease You in all\nthings. <\/b>            <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:O.

Living by the Spirit means a\nstep-by-step, moment-by-moment dependence on the Holy Spirit. Living by the Spirit is to\nfollow the leading of the Spirit and to remain in His control moment by moment in our\nchoices, actions and activities. Paul draws several contrasts between living for self and living\nby the Spirit. He lists the vices associated with living for self in\nverses 19-21 and declares that anyone living that kind of life\nwill not inherit the kingdom of God. He then goes on to say that\nthe life governed by the Spirit of God produces godly character\nand virtues (fruit of the Spirit).\n<\/p>\n<p>The only way to overcome sinful inclination is to allow\nthe Holy Spirit direct your life by heeding His instructions as\ncontained in the Word of God and by the prompting of your\nconscience.

On getting to Kamson\\'s\nresidence, Benedict told him about the love of\nChrist, how He died for our sins on the cross and the\nfact that He is coming back to gather the saved to\nheaven. On hearing this, Mr Kamson protested, \u201cThey\nhave been saying Jesus will come back again, even\nbefore my grandfather was born; yet He has refused to\nreturn. Why has He not returned?

To this, Peter replied that, to God, a thousand years is as one day,\nand one day as a thousand years. God does not count time as people do. In God\\'s\nsight, the whole universe is only a few days old. He is not limited by time the way\nwe are, nor does He measure it according to human standard. He is not slow in\nfulfilling His word; rather He is working according to His timetable, which is\ndifferent from ours.\n<\/p>\n<p>However, Peter assures that the coming of the Lord is\ncertain. The seeming delay in Christ\\'s second coming is\nbecause He is longsuffering and wants to give lost sinners\nthe opportunity to be saved.

And it has been removed from the\ndivine sanctuary at Shiloh for over seventy-five years.\nThe Philistines captured the ark when Eli was the judge\n(1 Sam. 4) and then returned it to the Jews because the\nLord sent judgment on the Philistines.\n<\/p>\n<p>David made elaborate plans to bring the ark to Jerusalem but the major\ninstruction to follow in carrying the ark was neglected. The ark must be borne by\nthe shoulders of the Levites (Numbers 4:9-20). Instead of following this, they\nmade a new cart to carry the ark. On their way, the cart stumbled. Uzzah sought\nto hold the ark and the Lord struck him dead for his error (2 Samuel 6:7). In\nanger, David, rather than taking the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, abandoned it in\nthe house of Obed-Edom. That the Lord blessed Obed-\nEdom and his household is a testimony that God\\'s\npresence is the most important thing that we need to\nbecome blessed in life; and that the problem is not with\nthe ark but the way it was handled.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot walk in error and expect God\\'s\nblessings. God\\'s work must be done according to His\nterms. As believers, we must be wary of designing\n\u201cnew cart\u201d to carry God\\'s ark. We must be careful not\nto abandon biblical principles for some new methods\nwhich negate the Word of God.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :No amount\no f u n i t y o r\ne n t h u s i a s m c a n\nc o m p e n s a t e f o r\ndisobedience. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought : We cannot walk in\nerror and expect\nGod\\'s blessings.<\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Check your life to see\nif there are areas you\nare walking contrary\nto God\\'s instruction\nand repent from such. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :L o r d ,\ndeliver me from\nevery error.

Apparently, there had not\nbeen a continuation of the sacrifices and of worship\nduring the reign of Saul. David now organised it. He\nappointed Asaph and his brethren to minister before\nthe ark continually with songs of praise daily. Though\nno sacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt,\nbecause the altars were not there; yet the worship at\nJerusalem was not restricted by the absence of these\nthings. Rather, David\\'s prayers were directed as the\nincense; and the lifting up of his hands and his voice as the sacrifice, thus setting\nprecedent for New Testament spiritual act of worship. However, David did not\nstop the ceremonial worship as commanded by Moses; rather He allowed Zadok\nthe priest and his fellow priests to continue that in Gibeon.\nTwo lessons are obvious from the passage: first, worshipping God should be an\neveryday and every moment experience. We should not get so busy that we neglect\nour time of fellowship with our Maker. No busyness or\nbusiness should strain our worship of God. Fellowshipping\nwith God should be the first work of the day and the last\nbefore we retire for the day. Second, we can worship God\nanywhere we find ourselves. We can worship God in our\noffices, our schools, and every other place we find\nourselves. A lifestyle of holiness and obedience to God is\nthe evidence of this continuous worship.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :Nothing\nshould strain the\nworship of our God. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Is\nmy fellowship with God growing or declining? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Re-organise your\nschedule to create\nmore time to fellowship with God. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :Father, draw\nme closer to You and\nset me free from all\nentanglements impeding my fellowship with You. <\/b>            <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\n\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\n\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\n\n<p>\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:F.

The first person they were to consider after reaping the harvest of the land the\nLord was giving them was God Himself who gave them the land. In bringing their\nfirst fruit to the chief priest, the people were to publicly declare God\\'s faithfulness\n(vv. 3, 5, 10); how He delivered them with a mighty hand from the slavery, toil and\noppression of Egypt. This would help them to focus on God as the giver of all that\nthey had, and a reminder of His concern for them during their difficult time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Giving is an integral part of our worship and our attitude when giving tells how\nmuch we appreciate God\\'s generosity towards us. When\nwe realise that there is nothing we have that has not been\ngiven us by God, we will consider Him first in giving our\nmoney, and material resources. The right response to\nevery act of God\\'s generosity is to show gratitude to Him,\nfirst in our hearts and then by our resources.

A younger waiting mother among the crowd went\nback home encouraged from the testimony she heard.\nAfter being told that Elizabeth was six months\npregnant, Mary went quickly to visit her older cousin\nwith the purpose of confirming what the angel had told\nher and to share experiences.\nWe can encourage each other as we share experiences\nof God\\'s miraculous deeds with others passing through\nthe same situation. Paul says God comforts us in our\ntribulations (and our joy too) that we may be able to comfort others through the\nsame comfort we have received from God (1Corinthians 1:4). It is expedient for\nbelievers to always be in godly circles where we can share in the joy of others.\nFamilies should share great moments of joy with one\nanother as Mary did with her cousin. Elizabeth\nprobably did not know initially that Mary would be the\nmother of the Messiah, but at the greeting of Mary, the\nbaby leaped with joy in her and the Holy Spirit revealed\nto her that Mary would give birth to Christ. She did not\nenvy or become jealous of Mary, but was happy with\nher. Do not envy others when their achievement seems\ngreater than yours; God has a plan for every individual\naccording to His will.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom : Accepting\nGod\\'s gifts, then\nusing them to praise\nand serve Him is\nwisdom.<\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Who are my friends:\nspirit lifters or spirit\nkillers? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Understand that God\nh a s d i f f e r e n t\npurposes for different\npeople.

Though God did not allow\nhim to build the house, it is obvious that God was\ntouched by the gesture. In response, God promised to\nbuild him a royal dynasty that will last forever. The\nultimate fulfilment of this promise is in Jesus Christ.\nGod is touched by appreciative and sacrificial giving\nand living. Parents can secure places in God\\'s heart as well as future blessings for\ntheir children through living and giving sacrificially. When we make God our\npriority and the work of the kingdom our top concern, God also takes us as\npriority. God\\'s promises are always trustworthy because His word is \\'yea and\namen.\\' We can live a lasting legacy of godliness which brings God\\'s favour for\nour children and generations yet unborn when we live as models of godliness and\nexamples of kingdom builders.

But this selfassured\nattitude can open the door for pride. David\nwould not ascribe any greatness to himself; he saw God\nas the source of all his successes. He considered the\nhonour he enjoyed from his people, not as a right, but\nsomething that came because of God\\'s love. With this\nmindset, David humbled himself, despite all the\nvictories he recorded in battles. He saw the\nawesomeness and uniqueness of God, above other gods.\nHe recognised the election and redemption of Israel\namong the nations of the world. Recognising God\\'s blessing on Israel and his\nfamily prompted David to burst into a prayer of praise and testimonies unto God.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\nPraising God for His good and gracious deeds in our lives is a good thing.\nGlorifying Him for His blessings is one way of\ndeclaring who He is: the King and sustainer of the\nuniverse. It also shows our total dependence on Him for\neverything we need. The record of David\\'s reference to\nGod\\'s redemption of Israelites from Egypt was a\ndeliberate action of the chronicler to encourage the\nexiles from Babylon. In the same way, when believers\ngive testimonies of God\\'s miracles, it serves to\nencourage others and it strengthens their faith in God.\nParents should pray for the future of their children even\nas they provide for their present needs.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<p><b> Wisdom :E v e r y\nsuccess is a product of\nGod\\'s mercy, not\nhuman smartness. <\/b>            <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\n<p><b> Food for Thought :Who do I ascribe\nglory to for life\\'s\nachievements: God,\nmyself or people? <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\n<p><b> Follow-up Action :Reflect on God\\'s love\nto you throughout this\nyear and praise Him. <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\n<p><b> Prayer :Lord, I\\'m\ngrateful for Your\ngrace upon my life\nthis year.

The revelation of God\\'s mind is a\ncall to join Him in what He is doing, according\nto Blackaby. It is also an attestation to God\\'s integrity. He\ndoes not do things arbitrarily. John\\'s vision of the\nheavenly temple and the ark of covenant shows that the\nbuilding of the temple and the placement of the ark in it in\n1Kings 8 is just an earthly fulfilment of what God had\nlong perfected in heaven. Therefore, the building of the\ntemple was not a mere coincidence; it was God\\'s plan,\nand David\\'s intention to build the temple was a divine\ninspiration. The temple and the ark of covenant later became Israel\\'s most sacred\ntreasure of the Old Testament.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\n<p>\nGod desires to relate with us, but to relate with Him requires a life of total\nobedience and sensitivity. When you are inspired to do\nsomething, be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit.\nA life of total dependence on the Holy Spirit helps us to\ndo the will of God. And God is honoured where His will\nis done. The believer\\'s body is God\\'s temple and His\nword the ark of covenant.

Everyone must refrain from\nself-seeking and arrogant attitude in the course of discharging their responsibilities\nin the church of God. An acceptable service before God should be our focus. We\nshould refrain from actions or inactions that could shift worshippers\\' focus away\nfrom God. Disorderliness could hinder God from\nworking among us. Each person has been placed in the\nchurch with gifts for the benefit of others. And love\nshould be the motivation as we make use of our spiritual\ngifts in worship. Families should worship God in their\nhomes in an atmosphere of love and orderliness, teaching\ntheir children to love, respect and honour God.
